<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>The setup of PowerJ is divided into 3 categories based on requirements and functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AP system: This shows as the name of your in-house pathology system (Copath, Powerpath or Cerner). It includes tables that exist in your AP system that require daily synchronization with PowerJ. A replica of these tables in available in PowerJ, and you use these replicas to define additional information that is required by PowerJ without disturbing the original system and voiding any warranties. You cannot modify the name or descrition of any item in these tables to enable PowerJ to determine if the original AP table has been modified. However, you must update the other data required by PowerJ whenever the original data has been modified, or additional items have been added.</p></li>
<li><p>PowerJ: These are the master (also called template or dictionary) tables that are unique to PowerJ, and are independant of your AP system. You modify them according to PowerJ requirememts.</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule: Although this is also a unique PowerJ table, it is separated from the others to allow 2 different persons to share responsibilty to manage the sysme if applicable.</p></li>
</ul>
