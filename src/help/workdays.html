<h1>Workdays</h1>
<p>Displays the clinical service schedule distribution among the pathologists over a specified period of time. To specify an entire year, enter the dates from Jan 1st to Dec 31, because the schedule uses dates without time. Other reports that are based on cases (eg, workload), where the date include the time of day, must enter the dates Jan 1st to Jan 1st to include the last day of the year.</p>
<BR>
<p>The table shows the total number of days on any service, plus the total number of days on each service.  Note that if someone is covering more that one service per day (eg, frozen section and on call), the the total number of services will exceed the total number of days.</p>
<BR>
<p>The table is initially sorted by the total number of days in descending order, but you can change the sort order by clicking on the column header of your choice.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Filter toolbar:</h2>
<p>The second toolbar on top of the screen below the quick access toolbar and above the charts, allows you to filter the schedule by facility.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Spin:</h2>
<p>This button switches the view between services and subspecialties.</p>
