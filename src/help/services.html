<h1>PowerJ Setup - Services</h1>
<p>These are the subunits of the clinical service schedule. You may require 1 to 5 pathologists to cover the GI service (GI-1, GI-2, GI-3, GI-4, GI-5). If the 5th pathologist will also cover liver, then the service can be called GI-Liv.  The services names will display in the schedule in alphabetical order.  Each service has the following entries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name: the name that will display in the <a href="schedule.html">Schedule</a> report.</p></li>
<li><p>Description: the duties covered by the service.</p></li>
<li><p>Days: select the days of the week that need to be covered. If you select call, it implies the entire week, including Saturday & Sunday.</p></li>
<li><p>Active: If de-selected, the service will not appear in the schedule.</p></li>
<li><p>Sub: If selected, the service is part of a subspecialty. If de-selected, the service is part of a specialty without a subspecialty (eg, cytology service)</p></li>
<li><p>Facility: the facility that the service belongs to (for multi-facility institutes).</p></li>
<li><p>Subspecialty: the subspecialty that the service belongs to.</p></li>
