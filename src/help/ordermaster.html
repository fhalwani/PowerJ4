<h1>Setup - Orders Master</h1>
<p>This is the screen where your institution-specific orders are matched to pre-defined orders that are included in PowerJ. Meaning, this is where you specify whatever special stains and IHC stains that you commonly order in your Anatomical pathology system (Powerpath&#64; or Cerner&#64;) can be interpreted by PowerJ pre-installed <a href="ordergroup.html">orders groups</a> that have a pre-defined order processing instructions.</p>
<BR>
<p>This table is a partial replica of your main anatomical pathology system, and it is synchronized automatically with the original table once a day every morning. You cannot edit the names, delete any row or add a new record manually to this table. Instead, use your Pathology system to manage it, and the changes will be replicated into PowerJ the next morning.</p>
<BR>
<p>Each entry has 3 fields that you use to control if orders entered in a case are managed by PowerJ data mining analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name: the name of the order that you entered in you AP system (not editable in PowerJ).</p></li>
<li><p>Description: the description that you entered in you AP system (not editable in PowerJ).</p></li>
<li><p>Group: the rule in the <a href="ordergroup.html">orders groups</a> to use to measure the workload of this order.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Note: The text field at the bottom of the screen displays a description of the group that you have selected.</h4>
<BR>
<h2>Filter toolbar:</h2>
<p>The second toolbar on top of the screen below the quick access toolbar and above the orders list, allows you to filter the orders by their groups. You also use it to filter newly added orders that require your attention to categorize by selecting the "Reject" group from the drop-down menu. You should make sure regularly that no orders remain orphaned or the cases that have this order will be rejected by the workflow and workload engines.</p>
