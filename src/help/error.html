<h1>Errors</h1>
<p>This screen displays the cases that were not coded by one or more of the workload systems due to a logical error or a data entry error.  The list on the left side of the screen is sorted by the accession number.  The text on the top right of the screen shows a text description of the steps the workload was counted to enable you to figure out the cause of the error.  The other 2 tables are a replica of the case <a href="editor.html">editor</a> screen</p>
<p>Since the specimen code is the most common cause of error encountered when coding the workload, you can take corrective measures to edit the specimen source right here. The case will then be re-coded on the next time that the coder runs, and if successful, the case will be removed from the error list the next day.</p>
