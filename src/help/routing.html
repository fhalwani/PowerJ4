<h1>Routing</h1>
<p>This report displays the cases routed to each pathologist daily (default) or weekly.</p>
<h2>Dates:</h2>
<p>Use the list on the left side of the screen to select which date you wish to view. If a daily report is selected (see filter toolbar below), then the list displays the last 5 workdays. If a weekly report is selected, it displays the last 3 weeks. The cutoff time for routing is displayed next to the date and can be modified in the <a href="setuppj.html">PowerJ Setup</a> screen. The bottom (earliest) date in the list is not selectable, and if you do, the tables will be blank.</p>
<h2>Cases Table:</h2>
<p>The bottom table shows the cases that have been routed. The table is initially sorted by the accession date, but you can change the sort order by clicking on the column header of your choice.</p>
<h2>Summary Table:</h2>
<p>The table in the middle of the screen shows a summary of case routing by pathologist, along with their initials, full name, number of cases, number of specimens, number of slides, number of <a href="code5.html">workload units</a> (in minutes), and the FTE equivalence. The table is initially sorted by wrokload in ascending order, but you can change the sort order by clicking on the column header of your choice.</p>
<h2>Workload Chart:</h2>
<p>The chart displays the total number of FTE units assigned to each pathologist, and is sorted in ascending order.</p>
<h2>Filter toolbar:</h2>
<p>The second toolbar on top of the screen below the quick access toolbar and above the charts, allows you to filter the data by facility, specialty or subspecialty. You can also use this toolbar to group the report on a daily or weekly basis.</p>
