<h1>Routing</h1>
<p>This report displays the cases routed to each pathologist on each day over the past 5 days.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Dates:</h2>
<p>Use the list on the left side of the screen to select which date you wish to view. If the time now has passed the cutoff time that is displayed with the date and can be modified in the <a href="setuppj.html">PowerJ Setup</a> screen, then tomorrow's date will also be shown at the top.  The last (earliest) date in the list is not selectable, and if you do, the tables will be blank.</p>
<h2>Cases Table:</h2>
<p>The bottom table shows the cases that have been routed. The table is initially sorted by the accession date, but you can change the sort order by clicking on the column header of your choice.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Summary Table:</h2>
<p>The table in the middle of the screen shows a summary of case routing by pathologist, along with their initials, full name, number of cases, number of specimens, number of slides, number of <a href="code5.html">workload units</a> (in minutes), and the FTE equivalence. The table is initially sorted by wrokload in ascending order, but you can change the sort order by clicking on the column header of your choice.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Workload Chart:</h2>
<p>The chart displays the total number of FTE units assigned to each pathologist, and is sorted in ascending order.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Filter toolbar:</h2>
<p>The second toolbar on top of the screen below the quick access toolbar and above the charts, allows you to filter the data by facility, specialty or subspecialty.</p>
