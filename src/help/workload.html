<h1>Workload</h1>
<p>This screen shows the various metrics that measure pathologists workload, including the total number of cases, blocks and slides, as well as the fulltime equivalence units (FTE) for CAP-ACP, W2Q, RCP, CPT and Code5 workload measurement systems (WMS). You can define what cases to be included in this report using the <a href="facility.html">facility</a>, <a href="accession.html">accession</a> and <a href="specialties.html">specialty</a> templates in the setup menu.</p>
<p>The report contains 6 pie charts that show the breakdown by cases and the 5 WMS from any row selected from the tree table row that you select.</p>
<h2>Dates:</h2>
<p>The report can generate daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual reports depending on the date that the cases were finalized. the time is from midnight of the start date to midnight of the end range; therefore to collect data of an entire week, select a date from Monday to Monday. Similarly, for an annual report, set the date from Jan 1<sup>st</sup> to Jan 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<h2>Rows:</h2>
<p>The report hierarchy can be specified by the drop down menu at the top. The default is facility, specialty, subspecialty, procedure, pathologist. To change the hierarchy to specialty then facility only, begin by setting pathologist to 0, then procedure to 0, then subspecialty to 0, then specialty to 1 (facility will move automatically to 2).</p>
<h2>Data Table:</h2>
<p>The table shows totals on the top (root), followed by the breakdown by the hierarchy that is defined in the rows (branches). The tree can be expanded or collapsed using the mouse button or the keyboard:</p>
