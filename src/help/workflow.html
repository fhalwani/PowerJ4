<p class="h1">The Workflow Chart</p>
<p>The third component in the dashboard (middle right corner of the main screen) is the case count analysis. This component summarizes two distinct types of information: Number of backlog cases and the amount of created versus completed cases (or tasks). Since the scale for case count differs from that of backlog case count, there are <U><B>two Y-axes</B></U> set in the chart. The primary Y-axis on the left, is used for the created and finalized case counts, whereas the secondary Y-axis on the right is used for backlog case counts. The x-axis represents the date in a short format (day/month)</p>
<BR>
<p class="h2">In vs. Out Cases:</p>
<p>The daily count of added and completed cases are formatted as overlapping bars, with the taller bar in the back behind the shorted bar. For each day, the light blue bar represents the number of new cases added (In), and the dark blue bar represents the number of completed cases (Out) for the specified task. Overlapping bars allows you to quickly determine if pending cases are increasing (light blue on top) or decreasing (dark blue on top).</p>
<BR>
<p class="h2">Pending Cases:</p>
<p>The line represents the total cumulative number of pending cases at the end of the day. The y axis of pending cases is on the right side of the chart.</p>
<BR>
<p class="h2">Chart Filtering:</p>
<p>You can restrict the Chart data to display only a specific subset of cases by using 2 of the drop-down lists in the menubar (Status and Specialty). See the <a HREF="menubar.html">"Menu Bar Help Page"</a> for further details.</p>
<BR>
<p class="h2">Formulas:</p>
<p>Workflow in broken into Cases In, Cases Out, and Pending Cases.  Cases In represents the total number of cases added to the specified date (gross, embedding, etc).  Cases Out is the cases that were completed on the specified date.  Pending cases is the sum of cases pending from this date and previous dates (Today Pending = Yesterday Pending + Cases In - Cases Out).</p>
