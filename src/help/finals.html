<h1>Finals</h1>
<p>This screen allows you to review how PowerJ is analyzing and coding the workload of cases that have been reported and make sure it is done correctly. The information is displayed in 5 tables and 1 notepad:</p>

<h2>Additionals:</h2>
<p>Additional clinical procedures that were performed by a different pathologist during of after finalizing the report. Examples are addenda, amendments, second opinions, reviews, correlations and presentation at tumor board. The workload units of these procedures are assigned to the pathologist who performed the procedure, wether done by the same or a different pathologist than the one who reported the case.

<li><p>DATE: the date and time of the procedure.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2>Notepad:</h2>
<p>This is a text describing the steps that PowerJ used to code the workload of the specimen. This text is deleted automatically after one year of finalizing the case.</p>
<h2>Filter toolbar:</h2>
<p>The second toolbar on top of the screen below the quick access toolbar and above the charts, allows you to filter the data by facility, specialty or subspecialty.</p>
