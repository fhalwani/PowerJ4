<h1>Forecast</h1>
<p>This screen shows the annual volume of each specimen from the years available in the system. For each year, the total count, blocks, slides, as well as the fulltime equivalence units (FTE) for CAP-ACP, W2Q, RCP, CPT and Code5 workload measurement systems (WMS).</p>
<p>The report contains 6 pie charts that show the breakdown by specimens and the 5 WMS from any row selected from the tree row that you select. It also extrapolates the data into the next 3 years (green squares).</p>
<h2>Rows:</h2>
<p>The report hierarchy can be specified by the drop down menu at the top. The default is facility, specialty, subspecialty, procedure, specimen. To change the hierarchy to specimen then facility only, begin by setting procedure to 0, then subspecialty to 0, then specialty to 0, then specimen to 1 (facility will move automatically to 2).</p>
<h2>Data Tree:</h2>
<p>The tree shows the total on the top (root), followed by a breakdown by the hierarchy that is defined in the rows (branches). The tree can be expanded or collapsed using the mouse button or the keyboard:</p>
