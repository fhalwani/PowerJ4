<h1>PowerJ Setup - PoweJ Rules</h1>
<p>PowerJ is programmed to process the specimens and orders according to preset rules. These rules cannot be modified or expanded without editing and recompiling the program from source code. If none of these rules works for your situation, please contact the <A HREF="mailto:fhalwani@gmail.com">programmer</a>. However, you can edit the names and description to add clarity to their use.  There are 37 choices to process the specimens:</p>
<BR>
<ul>
<li><p>0 - Unknown: the program will reject the case and generate an error. This code is used internally during table synchronization. When you encounter it in a template table, it means this item was added recently for you to review and revise.</p></li>
<li><p>1 - Ignore: No workload value. Use it for technical or research specimens and orders that do not have any workload value. An example is a specimen for 'Iron quantitation only' or an order for a 'Negative Control IHC slide'</p></li>
<li><p>100 - SP_CA_INCL: Code for the entire case as one single specimen, and with no additional orders or tests. An example is a neonatal autopsy case where the fetus and the placenta have been split into 2 separate specimens, but you wish to code the case as a whole.</p></li>
<li><p>101 - SP_CA_FIXED: Same as SP_CA_INCL above, but also code any orders or codes in the case. An example is a consultation report.</p></li>
<li><p>102 - SP_CA_GRO_MIC: Same as SP_CA_INCL above, but use value1 if the case does not have any stained slided, else use value2. An example is gross-only case, that occasionally may have an H&E slide performed.</p></li>
<li><p>103 - SP_CA_BL_EV_X: Code a case by the total number of blocks, every 1 to X blocks (CAP-L4E rule 9). For example, if count = 5 and value1 = 2, then the case with 23 blocks will get 10 units. Optionally, you can also set value2 to a minumum value, and/or value3 to a maximum value. For example if count = 5, value1 = 2, value2 = 7 and value 3 = 20, then a case with 3 blocks will earn 7, while a case with 58 blocks will earn 20 units.</p></li>
<li><p>104 - SP_CA_BL_123: Code a case by the total number of blocks, but with different values for block 1, block 2 and blocks higher than X. For example if count = 2, value1 = 3, value2 = 2 and value 3 = 1, then a case with 1 block will earn 3 units, a case with 2 blocks will earn 5 units, and a case with 5 blocks will earn 8 units.</p></li>
<li><p>105 - SP_CA_BL_12X: Code a case by the total number of blocks, but with different values for block 1, block 2 and all blocks higher than X, regardless of quantity. For example if count = 5, value1 = 3, value2 = 2 and value 3 = 1, then a case with 1 block will earn 3 units, a case with 2-5 blocks will earn 5 units, and a case with more than 5 blocks will earn 6 units. Additionally, you can set value 2 = 0, then any case with 1-5 blocks will earn 3 units, and any case with more than 5 blocks will earn 4 units.</p></li>
<li><p>106 - SP_CA_FR_EV_X: Code a case the same as SP_CA_BL_EV_X, but use the total number of fragments, instead of blocks. Used in CAP-L4E for breast and prostate specimens (although SP_LNK_EV_X may be a better choice in some cases).</p></li>
<li><p>107 - SP_CA_FR_123: Code a case the same as SP_CA_BL_123 but use the total number of fragments, instead of blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>108 - SP_CA_FR_12X: Code a case the same as SP_CA_BL_12X but use the total number of fragments, instead of blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>109 - SP_CA_FR_BL: Code a case by the total number of fragments or total number of blocks, whichever gives a higher value.</p></li>
<li><p>200 - SP_SP_INCL: Code each specimen separately, and with no additional orders or tests (RCP).</p></li>
<li><p>201 - SP_SP_FIXED: Code each specimen separately, but also code any orders or codes in the specimen (W2Q).</p></li>
<li><p>202 - SP_SP_GRO_MIC: Code each specimen separately, but use value1 if the specimen does not have any stained slided, else use value2. An example is gross-only specimen, that occasionally may have an H&E slide performed.</p></li>
<li><p>203 - SP_SP_EV_X: Code a case by the total number of specimens, every 1 to X (Bone marrow biopsy +/- aspirate +/- smear).</p></li>
<li><p>204 - SP_SP_123: Code a case by the total number of specimens, but with different values for specimen 1, specimen 2 and specimen higher than X (RCP-GI).</p></li>
<li><p>205 - SP_SP_12X: Code a case by the total number of specimens, but with different values for specimen 1, specimen 2 and all specimens higher than X, regardless of quantity (RCP-Prostate).</<li><p>206 - SP_BL_EV_X: Code each specimen by its number of blocks, every 1 to X blocks. For example, if count = 5 and value1 = 2, then the specimen with 23 blocks will get 10 units. Optionally, you can also set value2 to a minumum value, and/or value3 to a maximum value. For example if count = 5, value1 = 2, value2 = 7 and value 3 = 20, then a specimen with 3 blocks will earn 7, while a specimen with 58 blocks will earn 20 units.</p></li>
<li><p>207 - SP_BL_123: Code each specimen by its number of blocks, but with different values for block 1, block 2 and blocks higher than X. For example if count = 2, value1 = 3, value2 = 2 and value 3 = 1, then a specimen with 1 block will earn 3 units, a specimen with 2 blocks will earn 5 units, and a specimen with 5 blocks will earn 8 units.</p></li>
<li><p>208 - SP_BL_12X: Code each specimen by its number of blocks, but with different values for block 1, block 2 and all blocks higher than X, regardless of quantity. For example if count = 5, value1 = 3, value2 = 2 and value 3 = 1, then a specimen with 1 block will earn 3 units, a specimen with 2-5 blocks will earn 5 units, and a specimen with more than 5 blocks will earn 6 units. Additionally, you can set value 2 = 0, then any specimen with 1-5 blocks will earn 3 units, and any specimen with more than 5 blocks will earn 4 units.</p></li>
