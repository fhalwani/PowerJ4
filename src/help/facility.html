<h1>Setup - Facility</h1>
<p>This table is a partial replica of your main anatomical pathology system, and it is synchronized automatically with the original table once a day every morning. You should not edit the names, delete any row or add a new record manually to this table. Instead, use your Pathology system to manage it, and the changes will be replicated into PowerJ the next morning.</p>
<BR>
<p>Each entry has 2 additional columns that you use to control if cases from this facility are managed by PowerJ data mining analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Workflow: includes cases from this facility in workflow, backlog, routing and histology reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Workload: includes cases from this facility in workload, turn-around time, forecast and distribution reports.</p></li>
</ul>
<BR>
<p>Facility, <a href="specialties.html">Specialty</a> and <a href="accession.html">Accession</a> tables work together in defining the cases to be included or exluded in the workflow or workload tracking. You can deactivate all the cases from a facility in this table. Vice versa, you can deactivate all the autopsy cases in the <a href="specialties.html">Specialty</a> table. But to activate/deactivate certain subspecialties (consults, bone marrow) of a certain facility, you must also select/deselect it in the <a href="accession.html">Accession</a> table.</p>
