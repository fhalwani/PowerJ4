<h1>What is Code5?</h1>
<p>The results of our study<sup>1</sup> show that each workload measurement system (WMS) analysed in the study (CAP, W2Q, RCP & CPT) has a bias for or against certain subspecialty, specimens or procedure. This has a big impact on the workload measurement of pathologists in subspecialty practices, as well as a smaller impact on general pathologists because different institutes have different ratios of cytology, GI, Gyne and breast specimens, and different ratios of bopsy, excision and resection procedures.</p>
<BR>
<p>Until these issues are addressed, we recommend using the average of all 4 WMS, hence called code5.  It is calculated based on the average units of the accumulated units of all 4 WMS from nearly 400,000 specimens collected at our institute.  It is an all-inclusive code (specimen and all other related orders), except for frozen section analysis that has its own units.</p>
<BR>
<p>The units of Code5 are based on the number of unintereupted time to complete the case, calculated by the second, but displayed as minutes. The workload of a full-time pathologist (1 FTE) is 360 units (6 hours) per day, or 77,400 units (215 days) per year.  You can review your own data and see how Code5 compares to each specimen in the <a href="specimen.html">specimen</a> report.</p>
<BR>
<p>The units of Code5 are re-calculated annually based on your own institutional practice results, or as frequently as you wish by changing 2 variables in the <a href="setuppj.html">setup</a> screen.</p>
