<h1>Specimens</h1>
<p>This screen shows the various metrics that measure workload by specimen, including the frequency, number of blocks, slides, H&E, special stains, immunohistochemistry, as well as the fulltime equivalence units (FTE) for CAP-ACP, W2Q, RCP, CPT and Code5 workload measurement systems (WMS).</p>
<p>The report contains 6 pie charts that show the breakdown by specimens and the 5 WMS from any row selected from the tree row that you select.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Dates:</h2>
<p>The report can generate daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual reports depending on the date that the specimens were finalized. the time is from midnight of the start date to midnight of the end range; therefore to collect data of an entire week, select a date from Monday to Monday. Similarly, for an annual report, set the date from Jan 1<sup>st</sup> to Jan 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Rows:</h2>
<p>The report hierarchy can be specified by the drop down menu at the top. The default is facility, specialty, subspecialty, procedure, then specimen. To change the hierarchy to specialty then facility only, begin by setting the procedure to 0, then subspecialty to 0, then specialty to 1 (facility and specimen will move automatically to 2 and 3 respectively).</p>
<BR>
<h2>Data Table:</h2>
<p>The table shows totals on the top (root), followed by the breakdown by the hierarchy that is defined in the rows (branches). The tree can be expanded or collapsed using the mouse button or the keyboard:</p>
