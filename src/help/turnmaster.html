<h1>PowerJ Setup - Turnaround Time</h1>
<p>This is the setup table for how long a case should take from accession to final report under normal circumstances (i.e, no additional slides required). It is used in the <a href="specimenmaster.html">specimen setup</a> table to calculate workflow and turnaround time reports. It has the following fields defined:</p>
<BR>
<ul>
<li><p>Name: up to 16 characters.</p></li>
<li><p>Gross: business hours to finish grossing of the case.</p></li>
<li><p>Embed: business hours to finish embeding the blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Microtomy: business hours to finish microtomy of the blocks into unstained slides. There is no event recorded at our hospital for the slides staining therefore it cannot be assessed and the case is assumed to be ready for routing.</p></li>
<li><p>Route: business hours to route the case to the responsible pathologist.</p></li>
<li><p>Diagnosis: business hours for the pathologist to report and finalize the case.</p></li>
<li><p>Total: the sum of the above business hours.</p></li>
</ul>
<BR>
<p>PowerJ comes with pre-defined categories that you can update to your institution standards.</p>
<BR>
<p>Note that a case with multiple specimens inherits the turnaround time of its main specimen, wich is usually its largest although slowest specimen. For example, a case containing a colectomy with an omental biopsy will follow the rules of a colecotmy.</p>
