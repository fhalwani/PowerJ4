<h1>Business Hours</h1>
<p>Turnaround time is calculated in business hours to account for cases received late in the day or before a long weekend.</p>
<BR>
<p>For example if the laboratory working hours are from 6 am to 10 pm, a case cases received on Friday at 3 pm and signed out the next business day which happens to be a Tuesday after a long weekend at 1 pm will accumulate 7 hours on its accession date and 7 hours on its sign-out date, for a total of 14 business hours rather than 94 regular hours.</p>
