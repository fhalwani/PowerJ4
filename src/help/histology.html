<h1>Histology</h1>
<p>The histology dashboard consists of 3 charts showing the workflow of the three stations in histology:</p>
<BR>
<h2>Embedding:</h2>
<p>For each day over the past 6 workdays, the chart displays the number of blocks received from the grossing room in the amber bar, the number of blocks embedded in the green bar, and the number of backlog blocks are represented by a line with red circles.  The units of both Y-axis' are blocks, whereby the left-side Y-axis shows blocks received (in) and completed (out), while the right-side Y-axis shows the backlog blocks.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Microtomy:</h2>
<p>For each day over the past 6 workdays, the chart displays the number of blocks received from the embedding stations in the amber bar, the number of blocks microtomed in the green bar, and the number of backlog blocks are represented by a line with red circles.  The units of both Y-axis' are blocks, whereby the left-side Y-axis shows blocks received (in) and completed (out), while the right-side Y-axis shows the backlog blocks.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Routing:</h2>
<p>For each day over the past 6 workdays, the chart displays the number of slides received from the microtomy in the amber bar, the number of routed slides in the green bar, and the number of backlog slides are represented by a line with red circles.  The units of both Y-axis' are slides, whereby the left-side Y-axis shows slides ready for routing (in) and routed (out), while the right-side Y-axis shows the backlog slides of that day.</p>
<BR>
<h2>Filter toolbar:</h2>
<p>The second toolbar on top of the screen below the quick access toolbar and above the charts, allows you to filter the data by facility, subspecialty or procedure.</p>
