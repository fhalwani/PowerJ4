<h1>Auditors</h1>
<p>Auditing allows you to review how PowerJ is interpreting and manipulating the data and make sure it is done correctly. Errors can occur due to several reasons:</p>
<BR>
<ul>
<li><p>Programatic error: programmers are humans and will make mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>Ambiguity: programmers cannot predict and test for all possible scenarios; for example, we don't know how the program will treat a prostatectomy that has both an adenocarcinoma and a lymphoma combined in the same case.</p></li>
<li><p>Information error: a specimen, order or task that has a 10 unit value but has been mistakenly entered as 1.0 in its template.</p></li>
<li><p>Upstream error: A specimen has been inappropriately entered in the AP system. A common example is a medical liver biopsy is entered as a mass lesion liver biopsy.</p></li>
</ul>
<BR>
<p>PowerJ offers 3 modules to audit and review cases, and 1 module to correct specimen errors in the upstream AP system. These modules are:</p>
<BR>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="finals.html">Finals</a>: cases reported and finalized showing workflow and workload units.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="pending.html">Pending</a>: cases in the grossing room, histology or pathologists' desk showing workflow and predicted workload.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="error.html">Errors</a>: Cases detected by PowerJ and tagged as having an error; the most common error is having inadequate information about the specimen/test category, or encountering a new unknow specimen/test.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="editor.html">Specimen Editor</a>: A screen allowing you to correct the information in your institution system without having to amend the case.</p></li>
</ul>
