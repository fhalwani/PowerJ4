<h1>PowerJ Setup - Specialties</h1>
<p>Used to group <a href="specimengroup.html">specimens</a> and <a href="subspecialty.html">subspecialties</a> into autopsy, cytology or surgical pathology.</p>
<p>Each entry has these fields that you use to control if cases from this facility are managed by PowerJ data mining analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Workflow: includes cases from this specialty in workflow, backlog, routing and histology reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Workload: includes cases from this specialty in workload, turn-around time, forecast and distribution reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Code Specimen: should be disabled whenever the specimen itself has no value and only the orders are to be coded in the workload (consults or molecular reports).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="facility.html">Facility</a>, Specialty and <a href="accession.html">Accession</a> tables work together in defining the cases to be included or exluded in the workflow or workload tracking. You can deactivate all the cases from a facility in the <a href="facility.html">Facility</a> table. Vice versa, you can deactivate all the autopsy cases in this table. But to activate/deactivate certain subspecialties (consults, bone marrow) of a certain facility, you must also select/deselect it in the <a href="accession.html">Accession</a> table.</p>
<p>You can add a new specialty by first scrolling the list on the left side of the screen to the bottom with the arrows or mouse. You will see a blank item that you can select, then fill-in the required fields.</p>
