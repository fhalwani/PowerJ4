<h1>Setup - Specimens Master</p>
<p>This is the screen where your institution-specific specimens are matched to the pre-defined specimens that are included in PowerJ. Meaning, if your institution has a specimen called "Appendix", you match it to the PowerJ specimen called "Appendectomy", therefore the specimen workload will be coded as an appendectomy.</p>
<p>This table is a partial replica of your main anatomical pathology system, and it is synchronized automatically with the original table once a day every morning. You cannot edit the names, delete any row or add a new record manually to this table. Instead, use your Pathology system to manage it, and the changes will be replicated into PowerJ the next morning.  Each entry has 4 fields that you use to control how cases are managed by PowerJ data mining analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Name: the name of the order that you entered in you AP system (not editable in PowerJ).</p></li>
<li><p>Description: the description that you entered in you AP system (not editable in PowerJ).</p></li>
<li><p>Turnaround: the rule in the <a href="turnmaster.html">turnaround time</a> to use to measure the workflow and backlog.</p></li>
<li><p>Group: the rule in the <a href="specimengroup.html">Specimens Groups</a> to use to measure the workload of this specimen.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Filter toolbar:</h2>
<p>The second toolbar on top of the screen below the quick access toolbar and above the charts, allows you to filter the specimens by specialty, subspecialty and procedure. You also use filter button to filter newly added specimens that require your attention to categorize. You should make sure regularly that no specimen remains orphaned or the case will be rejected by the workflow and workload engines.</p>
