<p class="h1">Pathology System Setup - Persons</p>
<p>This is the screen where your institution-specific personnel are matched to additional fields required by PowerJ. This table is a partial replica of your main anatomical pathology system, and it is synchronized automatically with the original table once a day every morning. You cannot edit the names, delete any row or add a new record manually to this table. Instead, use your Pathology system to manage it, and the changes will be replicated into PowerJ the next morning.</p>

<p>You cannot edit the names, delete any row or add a new record manually to this table. Instead, use your institution's Pathology system (Powerpath&#64;, Copath&#64;) to manage it, and the changes will be replicated into PowerJ the next morning.</p>
<BR>
<p>Each entry has these additional entries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initials: the initials of the person that will be displayed in PowerJ tables and reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Active: is the person still working for the department.</p></li>
<li><p>Access: Which reports or functionality in PowerJ this person is allowed to view.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Note: View Names allows the person to view other staff names in the reports; otherwise the names will be masked.</h4>
