<h1>Setup - Persons</p>
<p>This is the screen where your institution-specific personnel are matched to additional fields required by PowerJ. This table is a partial replica of your main anatomical pathology system, and it is synchronized automatically with the original table once a day every morning. You cannot edit the names, delete any row or add a new record manually to this table. Instead, use your Pathology system to manage it, and the changes will be replicated into PowerJ the next morning.</p>
